This directory contains all the data used for the results of the thesis.  

## Structure

All folders for the different experiments have the same structure and contain subsequent directories with the data, model checkpoints and corresponding results. Within each directory the data and results are identifieable by the max-stable model and/or the estimation method.

| Folder | Description |

| `all_models_large` | Data related to the robustness scenario 3. |
| `all_models_small` | Data related to the robustness scenario 3. |
| `application` | Data related to the empirical application. |
| `normal` | All data related to the normal results. |
| `outside_model` | All data related to the robustness scenario 2 & 4. |
| `outside_parameters` | All data related to the robustness scenario 1. |
